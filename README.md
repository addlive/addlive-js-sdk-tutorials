AddLive JavaScript SDK Tutorials
================================


This sample project aims at flattening the learning curve of the AddLive SDK.
Each tutorial provided showcases single area of features, using fully functional
(but simple) web application. Read more at http://www.addlive.com.

It is strongly advised not to access those tutorials using the file:// protocol.
For your convenience we have provided a tiny http server written in python that
can act as bundled application server. It does not have any dependencies other
then core python.

To start the server just use following command:

```
python tiny_http_server.py
```

And access the tutorials using localhost: http://localhost:8080

Tutorial 1  - Initializing the platform
---------------------------------------

This tutorial covers the very first step that needs to be done to create AddLive
powered web application - initialization of the AddLive Platform. Within this
tutorial, we will create a sample application that:

- Loads the AddLive SDK.
- Initializes the AddLive Logging (for development purposes).
- Initializes the AddLive Platform.
- Installs the AddLive Plug-in if required.
- Performs sample call to the AddLive Service to obtain it's version.
- Has simple UI showing the initialization progress bar, installation button (if
required) and Platform SDK version.

Tutorial 2 - Devices configuration
----------------------------------

This tutorial covers the basics of multimedia devices configuration - getting the installed devices, getting the device currerntly used by the platform and finally choosing a device.
Within this tutorial, we will create a sample application that:

- Loads the AddLive SDK.
- Initializes the AddLive Logging (for development purposes).
- Initializes the AddLive Platform.
- Requests list of multimedia devices plugged in to user's computer.
- Allows the user to select a device which should be used by the platform.

Tutorial 3 - Advanced devices handling
--------------------------------------

This tutorial covers more advanced devices configuration. We will learn how to control the speakers volume or microphone gain; how to play a sample audio file to check whether the volume level is fine and finally and finally how to render speech level indicator to verify the microphone gain.
Within this tutorial, we will create a sample application that:

- Loads the AddLive SDK.
- Initializes the AddLive Logging (for development purposes).
- Initializes the AddLive Platform.
- Requests list of multimedia devices plugged in to user's computer.

Tutorial 4 - Video sinks rendering
----------------------------------

This tutorial covers one of the core AddLive SDK features - video rendering. In
order to understand this tutorial completely, one need to know basic rendering
concepts like a video sink and a renderer.

#### Video sink

Video sink is a source of raw video frames. There are two cases that
trigger video sink creation - it is being created for the local user's preview
when calling the CDO.AddLiveService#startLocalVideo and for remote participants'
video feeds. Additionally, every video sink has a unique id associated to it.

#### Video renderer

Video renderer is an UI component that can display video frames provided
by a video sink. Internally it's just an Object with same mime type as the
AddLive Plug-in, but with a configuration options indicating that it should be
treated as a rendering item rather then platform functionality provider. Each
video sink can have multiple video renderers attached and single renderer is
capable of rendering only one video sink. Video renderer recognizes several
options controlling its behaviour. It can be windowed or windowless (makes
effect only on Microsoft Windows operating system. Under OS X rendering is
always windowless), mirrored or not and finally can use 2 types of scaling
filters: bilinear (less CPU intrusive, worse quality) and bicubic (more CPU
intrusive, better quality).

It is also important to note that the renderer dimensions does not have to match
the ones of the video sink being rendered. A renderer can have arbitrary
dimensions, even with a different aspect ratio then the video sink being
rendered. In such a case, the renderer will scale and crop frames to maintain
the aspect ratio of the source and also desired dimensions. It is a good
practice to render the same source with same aspect ratio on both local and
remote side. In short, a user should see his preview in a same way as will be
seen by the remote participant. The sizes might be different, no problem here.
But using different aspect ratio may cause a rare case when portion of the video
feed expected by the user to be seen by the remote party will be lost due to
cropping.

Within this tutorial, we will create a sample application that:

- Loads the AddLive SDK.
- Initializes the AddLive Logging (for development purposes).
- Initializes the AddLive Platform.
- Starts local user's preview video feed.
- Renders local user's preview video feed using 4 renderers, with different configurations.
- Fetches the list of plugged in video capture devices.
- Allows a user to select a video capture device.
